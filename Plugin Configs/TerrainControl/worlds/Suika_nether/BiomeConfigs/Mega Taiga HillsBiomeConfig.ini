# Smooth radius between biomes. Must be between 0 and 32, inclusive. The resulting

# So if two biomes next to each other have both a smooth radius of 2, the
# resulting smooth area will be (2 + 1 + 2) * 4 = 20 blocks wide.
SmoothRadius: 2

# If this value is greater than 0, then it will affect how much, on average, the terrain will rise before leveling off when it begins to increase in elevation.
# If the value is less than 0, then it will cause the terrain to either increase to a lower height before leveling out or decrease in height if the value is a large enough negative.
MaxAverageHeight: 0.0

# If this value is greater than 0, then it will affect how much, on average, the terrain (usually at the ottom of the ocean) will fall before leveling off when it begins to decrease in elevation. 
# If the value is less than 0, then it will cause the terrain to either fall to a lesser depth before leveling out or increase in height if the value is a large enough negative.
MaxAverageDepth: 0.0

# Another type of noise. This noise is independent from biomes. The larger the values the more chaotic/volatile landscape generation becomes.
# Setting the values to negative will have the opposite effect and make landscape generation calmer/gentler.

# Adjust the weight of the corresponding volatility settings. This allows you to change how prevalent you want either of the volatility settings to be in the terrain.

# Block and BlockSource: can be id or name, Frequency - is count of attempts for place resource
# Rarity: chance for each attempt, Rarity:100 - mean 100% to pass, Rarity:1 - mean 1% to pass
# MinAltitude and MaxAltitude: height limits
# BlockSource: mean where or whereupon resource will be placed 
# TreeType: Tree (original oak tree) - BigTree - Birch - TallBirch - SwampTree
#    HugeMushroom (not a tree but still counts) - Taiga1 - Taiga2 - HugeTaiga1 - HugeTaiga2
#    JungleTree (the huge jungle tree) - GroundBush - CocoaTree (smaller jungle tree)
#    DarkOak (from the roofed forest biome) - Acacia
#    You can also use your own custom objects, as long as they have set Tree to true in their settings.
# TreeType_Chance: similar Rarity. Example:
#    Tree(10,Taiga1,35,Taiga2,100) - plugin tries 10 times, for each attempt it tries to place Taiga1 (35% chance),
#    if that fails, it attempts to place Taiga2 (100% chance).
# PlantType: one of the plant types: Allium, AzureBluet, BlueOrchid, BrownMushroom, Dandelion, DeadBush, DoubleTallgrass, Fern, LargeFern, Lilac, OrangeTulip, OxeyeDaisy, Peony, PinkTulip, Poppy, RedMushroom, RedTulip, RoseBush, Sunflower, Tallgrass, WhiteTulip
#    or simply Block[:Data]
# IceSpikeType: one of the ice spike types: Basement,SmallSpike,HugeSpike
# Object: can be a any kind of custom object (bo2 or bo3) but without the file extension. You can
# also use UseWorld to spawn one of the object in the WorldObjects folder and UseBiome to spawn
# one of the objects in the BiomeObjects setting. When using BO2s for UseWorld, the BO2 must have
# this biome in their spawnInBiome setting.
# Object_Chance: Like TreeType_Chance.

# Plant and Grass resource: both a resource of one block. Plant can place blocks underground, Grass cannot.
# Liquid resource: a one-block water or lava source
# SmallLake and UnderGroundLake resources: small lakes of about 8x8 blocks
# Vein resource: not in vanilla. Starts an area where ores will spawn. Can be slow, so use a low Rarity (smaller than 1).
# CustomStructure resource: starts a BO3 structure in the chunk.
